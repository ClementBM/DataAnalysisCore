# DataAnalysisCore is a small C# library for data analysis

I created it for studying reasons as I was following the Machine Learning Course of Andrew Ng https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning

Currently the code is not optimized at all, I'd rather tried to make it simple to use.

[Demo coming soon ...]
